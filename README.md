# Interoperability of highway toll stations in Greece 

This repository hosts the semester project in the course of Software Engineering (7th semester, ECE - NTUA). The topic of the project was to build a web application that displays information about passes from one toll station to another. This data is graphically represented (using charts.js) and is thoroughly processed for settling the financial debt among toll stations. The project also includes the development of CLI that enables administrative operations. Functionality of the app is demonstrated through extensive testing using Postman.

Some instances of the web app are displayed below:
